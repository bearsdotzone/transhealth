## Affirming Resources

## Why
The youth of Texas are under attack. In 2022 Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas released a horrifying [opinion](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2022/kp-0401.pdf) equating gender affirmative healthcare with child abuse and Governor Greg Abbott of Texas [directed](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-MastersJaime202202221358.pdf) the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate reports of gender affirming care as abuse. Paxton's opinion and Abbott's direction are transphobic bullshit. This resource exists to educate people on obtaining puberty blockers while minimizing the risk of being reported.

### The Law
Puberty blockers are not a controlled substance. Puberty blockers are not available over the counter in the United States. You can still get puberty blockers though, usually from other territories.
